> Nickel schemas for project state and policy, with export to ECOSYSTEM.scm

== What This Is Now

elegant-STATE has been *simplified*. The complex infrastructure (GraphQL, event sourcing, multi-agent coordination) is archived. What remains is the elegant core:

- *Policy schemas* - What rules look like in Nickel
- *Ecosystem schemas* - What project registries look like
- *Export to SCM* - Generate ECOSYSTEM.scm from Nickel configs

== Why Simplified?

The original elegant-STATE tried to solve orchestration with complexity. The insight from [Conative Gating](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/conative-gating) was:

> Orchestration becomes trivially simple when enforcement works.

If an SLM actually enforces policy, you don't need elaborate coordination machinery. You need:
1. A way to describe policy (Nickel)
2. A way to describe the ecosystem (Nickel)
3. A way to export to homoiconic format (Racket → SCM)

== Structure

```
elegant-STATE/
├── schema/
│   ├── policy.ncl       # Policy schema
│   └── ecosystem.ncl    # Project registry schema
├── export/
│   └── to-scm.rkt       # Export to ECOSYSTEM.scm
└── examples/
    ├── policy.ncl       # Example policy
    └── ECOSYSTEM.scm    # Example ecosystem file
```

== Usage

```bash
= Validate a policy
nickel typecheck schema/policy.ncl

= Export to ECOSYSTEM.scm
racket export/to-scm.rkt examples/policy.ncl > ECOSYSTEM.scm
```

== The Archived Infrastructure

The original v0.1.0 implementation (Rust + GraphQL + Sled + coordinator system) is preserved in `.archive/` for reference. It was a functional MVP that exceeded its original scope - but the complexity was the message that a simpler approach was needed.
